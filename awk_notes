	Introduction to awk programming language

	1. awk is very similar to C-language. The statements line if, for, while statements are there.
	2. The statements in awk program should not be terminated by semicolon(;).
	3. To display any output we can use print or printf. In printf we can use 
	format like c-language and in print we can not format.
	4. The statements like if(), while(), for  must contain { and }
	5. To read data from keyboard we a statement called getline.
           example getline n < "\dev\tty"  --> It will allow to enter data in 'n'.
	6. We don't have to declare any varibale unlike c-language.
	7. In awk we can perform floating point operation.
           example :  y=5/2=2.5
	8. In awk program there are 3 sections :
           BEGIN{

           ----
           ----
           }
           
	   Mid_section
	   {
           ---
           }
           END{
           ----
           }

         Normally we use BEGIN section in any awk program.
	9. To execute any shell script/command we have to call a function system().
	   Example:
	   system("clear")
	   system("tput cup 10 20")
	   system("a.out")
	   system("awk -f myfile.awk")

problem-1: awk_1.awk : Write a program in awk to input 2 numbers. calulate sum and average
                       of 2 numbwers.

         Some important points:
	Point-1: The file should be save as file_name.awk
        Point-2: To execute any awk program we do the following:
                $ awk -f filename.awk <enter>
