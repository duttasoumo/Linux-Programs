	Introduction to Linux Operating System
	--------------------------------------

	Some Important Features of Linux Operating System:

	1. Linux is a Multi user and Multi Programming Operating 	System.
	2. Initially the name of the operating system was UNIX. 
	3. LINUX free software. We can download it from internet.
	4. The main advantage of Linux is that it is completely v	virus free OS unlike Windows.
	5. Internet Backbone essentially Linux OS.
	6. It is highly secured operating system. An user can 
	tamper/modify only his/her file. A normal user can not 
	tamper the file of another user until and unless the
	the permission is given to the user.
	7. In Linux Operating one user is called super user who
	can create new user or can edit/modify/remove any other
	file. The super user must know the password of Root. 
	Normally the password of Root file system is kept secret.	 8. The command prompt of normal user is shown as $ and
	the command prompt of super user is shown # sign.
	
	How to Load Linux Operating System in your machine:
	
	Step-1: Restart your machine and go on pressing Down 
	Arrow key for some time. It will show a menu and select 
	CENTOS from there. Press Enter Key.
	Step-2: It will load Linux OS and will show UserID=
	Step-3: Type user-ID = cmsa_3
	Step-4: Type Password = cmsa_3
	It will load Linux and will display the file system of 
	Desktop.
	9. In Linux all commands are essentially files. If a file 	is missing then that command will not work.
	10. The main Linux OS is called Kernel. Without this we
	can not boot a machine. Outside Kernel we have many 
	more more files which we can use to operate in various 
	files.
