	Introduction to Shell Script 

	1. In shell scripts we write linux commands. A series 
	of commands may be saved in any file say "shell_1". To 
	execute "shell_1" we do the following:
        $ sh shell_1 <enter>  --> The file sh can execute any 
	shell script.
	2. To display any data on screen we use a command 
	echo "message".
	3. To perform any calculation we do the following:
	a=5
	b=6
	c=`expr $a + $b`  --> To perform any arithmetic 
	operation we have to use expr.
	4. To read data from key board we use a statement called read.
	Example: read a
 	5. Any comment line will begin with a # sign.  
	Example : # shell_1 : Write a program to calculate sum of 2 numbers
	6. We can use use control statements such as 
	(i) 
	if [  condition  ]
	then
	---
	---
	fi
	(ii) if [ condition ]
	     then
	     ----
             ----
             else
             ----
             ----
             fi
	(iii) if [ condition_1 ]
	      then
              -----
              -----
              elif [ condition_2 ]
              then
              ----
              ----
              elif [ condition_3 ]
	      then              
	      ----
              ----     
              else
              ----
              ----
              fi
	(iv) break statement  : It is used to break a loop
        Loop statement:
	   (i) while  [ condition ]
               do
               -----
               -----
               done

           (ii) for var in [ v1,v2,v3....]
                do
                ----
                ----
                done

        To use subscripted variable in shell script:
        
        Subscripted variables are nothing array type variable. We define 
	subscripted variable as follows:
	i=2
	eval a$i=5   # a[i]=5
	s=0
	eval s=`expr $s + \$a$i`
        In linux we can 1-dimensional array or 2-dimensional array.

	problem-1: shell_1 : Write a program to input roll(1-100), 
	total(0-100). Calculate grade as follows:
        (i) if total>=70 then grade="A"
        (ii)if total>=60 then grade="B"
	(iii) if total>=50 then grade="C"
	(iv) if total>=40 then grade="D"
	(v) if total<40 then grade="F"
	Print roll,total,grade.
	Do it 'n' number of students where n>=1 and n<=20.

	relational operators in Linux :
	==  : -eq
	>   : -gt
	<   : -lt
	>=  : -ge
	<=  : -le
	!=  : -ne
	
	problem-3: shell_3 : Write a program to input 'n' where n>=1
	and n<=10.  Calculate s=1-2+3-4 ....n. print s.
	
	problem-4: shell_4: Write a program to input 'n' where n>=1 and
	n<=20. Input 'n' arbirary numbers in 1 -dimensional array say 'a'.
	Calculate and print (i) sum of all elements, (ii) average of all
	elements, (iii) largest value.
