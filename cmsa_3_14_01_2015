	Implementation of Numerical Methods using C++ Programming
	Language.

	Some Important Features of C++ programming language:
	---------------------------------------------------
	1. C++ is Object Oriented programming language.
	2. In Object oriented language we first define something called
	   class. In a class one can define data and member functions.
	   So a class is a combination of data and member functions.
	3. In a class we have mainly two sections one is called private 
	   and the other is called public. 
        4. All member functions in class can envoke any other member functions
	   of the same class. To access the member functions of class one
	   can define an object which is also called the instance of a class.
           Using object one can access all public member functions from
	   outside that class.
        5. A Class can pass the property to another class using a method
           called inheritance. In C++ we have single level inheritance, multi
	   level inheritance, Multiple inheritance.
	6. All statements used in "C" language can be used as it is in C++.
	7. main() function should not be part of a class unlike C# or Java.
	8. The header file to be used in C++ is iostream.h
	9. To input data from keyboard we a object cin. To display some output
	   on screen we use object cout.
           Example:   cout<<"Enter any number=";
		      cin>>a;
	10. In Linux to clear screen we use system("clear"); 
	

	
	Problem-1: prob_1.cpp : Write a program in C++ to input two integers
	say a,b. Calculate sum, average of 2 integers.
